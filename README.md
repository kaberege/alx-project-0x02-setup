# Next.js Project Setup and Basics.

Welcome to the repository for **SoloForge: Mastering Project Autonomy**, a foundational project designed to help you get comfortable setting up and working with modern web development tools such as **Next.js**, **TypeScript**, and **Tailwind CSS**.

The purpose of this repository is to:

* Scaffold a professional-grade Next.js application.
* Learn how to organize code with reusable components and a proper project structure.
* Practice routing, state management, and API integration.
* Build a clean, responsive interface using Tailwind CSS.

This setup marks the starting point for developing a modern web application and serves as a solid base for further feature development throughout the project.
